Text Generation Model
Generate coherent paragraphs using the GPT-2 language model with the Hugging Face Transformers library.

Overview
This project demonstrates a simple text generation model leveraging the GPT-2 transformer. It lets users input a text prompt and generates coherent continuation paragraphs, showcasing capabilities of modern large language models (LLMs) in natural language generation.

Installation
To get started, install the necessary Python packages via:

text
pip install -r requirements.txt
The requirements include:

transformers

torch

Usage
Run the text generation script:

text
python text_generation.py
You will be prompted to enter a text prompt. Based on your input, the GPT-2 model will generate and output a continuation paragraph.

Project Structure
text_generation.py: Main script to load the GPT-2 model, take user input, generate text, and print output.

requirements.txt: Lists Python dependencies required.

README.md: This file.

How It Works
The script loads the GPT-2 pretrained model and tokenizer.

It encodes your prompt input into tokens.

It generates text by predicting token sequences based on the prompt.

The generated tokens are decoded back to readable text and printed.

Customization
Modify max_length and num_return_sequences in text_generation.py to control generation length and number of outputs.

You can add GPU support by specifying device configurations if available.
